# lego_mindstorms_nxt_controller
Instructions for cheap, fun, and easy way to control a computer (with keystrokes and mouse) wirelessly from an NXT Joystick using bluetooth, conductors/wires/alligator clips, and a board such as a MakeyMakey or Arduino Leonardo (or a modified Arduino Uno).


Goal: 
Use a lego mindstorms joystick to send keystrokes to a computer with USB connectivity without expensive hardware such as a BrickPi/Arduino NXT Shield and only using the basic NXT-G software that comes with the NXT.


Difficulty:
Ages 8+ for construction and use with a MakeyMakey, 12+ for modifying the design and programming to customize further, and 15+ to use non-MakeyMakey boards (will require non-graphical programming knowledge and possibly flashing board firmware at your own risk)


Steps: 
1: Acquire supplies: 2 Lego Mindstorms NXT's (v1.2 or v2.0), 4 mindstorms NXT/EV3 motors and cables, 1 NXT v1.2 or v2.0 touch sensor and cable, a MakeyMakey (or other board as mentioned above), a lego kit with similar/actual parts included in the NXT/EV3 kits, alligator clips (6-10), breadboard jumper wires (6-10), aluminum foil, and masking tape. 

2: Assemble the Joystick based on these instructions: http://www.philohome.com/nxtjoystick/joystick.htm

3: Download the joystick.rbt to the joystick and reciever.rbt to the other NXT brick to be used as a bluetooth reciever.
