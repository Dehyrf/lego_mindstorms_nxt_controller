# lego_mindstorms_nxt_controller
Code (.rbt files for NXT) and instructions for cheap, fun, and easy way to control a computer (with keystrokes and mouse) wirelessly from a NXT using bluetooth, conductors/wires/alligator clips, and a board such as a MakeyMakey or Arduino Leonardo (or a modified Arduino Uno).

Goal: 
Use a lego mindstorms joystick to send keystrokes to a computer with USB connectivity without expensive hardware such as a BrickPi/Arduino NXT Shield and only using the basic NXT-G software that comes with the NXT.

Difficulty:
Ages 7+ for construction and use with a MakeyMakey, 12+ for modifying the design and programming to customize further, and 15+ to use non-MakeyMakey boards (will require non-graphical programming knowledge and possibly flashing board firmware at your own risk)

Steps: 
1: Acquire supplies: 2 Lego Mindstorms NXT's (v1.2 or v2.0), 4 mindstorms NXT/EV3 motors and cables, a MakeyMakey (or other board as mentioned above), a lego kit with similar/actual parts included in the NXT/EV3 kits, alligator clips (6-10), breadboard jumper wires (6-10), aluminum foil, and masking tape.
